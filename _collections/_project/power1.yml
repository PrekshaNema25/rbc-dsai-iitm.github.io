  abstract: The demand for electrical energy is increasing twice as fast as it is being used. This necessities the need for generating electricity from many sources, transmitting and distributing with augmented efficiency and conserving through optimal usage. With the advent of Smart Grid technologies, meeting the energy demands of the future seems very much possible.
Even though the reach of Smart Grid technologies is limited at present, a large amount of data, pertaining to variables like voltage, current, power, etc. on an hourly or half hourly basis, is being generated from the smart meters. The data can be analyzed to improve and expanding Smart grid technologies for Indian markets.
The project envisages the analysis of Smart Grid Data with an aim to achieve the following objectives:
  - Reconstruction of the underlying network topology accurately, even in the presence of noise or missing data.
  - Developing models to validate the data. This is important given the possibilities of cyber-attacks on the Smart Grid, which is also an   	     example of cyber-physical systems.
  - Developing effective and efficient ways of Fault prediction and Theft detection.
  - Evaluation of the proposed methods and models through real data collected from an existing grid.
  - Forecasting the demand utilizations based on historical data.

abstract:With the increased success of Deep Learning techniques in visual systems, there has been Deep Learning works specific to the areas of interest for Autonomous Driver Assist Systems (ADAS). These include vehicle detection, vehicle tracking, pedestrian detection, lane detection, semantic segmentation etc. In the project we explore the use of convolutional neural networks in detection, classification and semantic segmentation in the context of ADAS. We propose to extend image based algorithms to videos and eventually look to explore efficient implementations on DSP processors.

abstract:Rich real-time traffic data is being obtained using advanced sensors such as Video and GPS as well as communication technologies at a data centre in the Intelligent Transportation Systems laboratory. This data offers tremendous scope to investigate empirical patterns and use these insights to operate and manage the transportation system towards desired objectives including reduced congestion, improved reliability and safety, better fuel efficiency and decrease in environmental pollution. The focus of this work will be to mine this data to derive empirical understanding and develop models towards this broad goal. Specific focus areas include: quantification of the ITS data to investigate the role of various sources that affect system performance (demand, incidents, weather, construction, special events, control devices etc.) and applying this knowledge towards the development of algorithms for optimizing and improving system performance.
Illustrative applications could include:
  - Algorithms based on data fusion from various real-time data sources
  - Traffic control state prediction from real-time data
  - Quantification of system performance for mixed traffic using vehicle trajectory level data

abstract: Traffic congestion is one of the major challenges faced by traffic engineers all over the world. Solutions ranging from major infrastructure development to smaller traffic management measures such as reversible lanes and one way roads are being tried out to address this problem. One such solution to alleviate congestion, with minimal infrastructure, is to manage the traffic in real time using advanced technologies and methodologies. Such solutions are part of the general area of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These solutions are required to be developed as an integral part of the smart city initiatives by the Government of India.
The basic requirement for a congestion prediction system is to identify effective methods for quantifying congestion. Density, which is the number of vehicles over a length of roadway, is one of the most widely used congestion indicators. Travel time is another traffic variable that can indicate the congestion. However, due to the spatial nature of these variables, it is difficult to measure them directly from the field. Hence, it is usually estimated from point measurements of variables such as flow or speed. However, these variables have limitations in capturing the spatial variations. A data fusion approach, where data collected from more than one source, can be adopted under such scenarios for better accuracy. In the proposed study, quantification and prediction of traffic congestion will be attempted using location based and spatial data independently as well as based on a fusion approach. This would be done with the help of data obtained from location based sensors such as using video cameras and spatial data (mainly travel time) obtained using Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices and smart phone based crowd sourcing, in addition to traffic related information collected from other sources such as blue tooth devices, social media, etc

subdomain: water distribution network
abstract: There has been an alarming decrease in the availability of fresh water supplies in recent years. This has led to increased focus on the generation, conservation, reuse and equitable distribution of this scarce resource. Urban water distribution networks in India are fairly old, poorly instrumented and not maintained properly leading to significant leakage. Municipalities in India officially report that 30-35% water is lost in leakages. Furthermore, due to insufficient water availability, the water supply is intermittent and is not equitably distributed. Advances in instrumentation, automation and information technology can be exploited to significantly reduce leakages, improve and guarantee water quality and also distribute the available water in a just and equitable manner. These technological advances have also provided the tools to optimize the design and operation of existing as well as new facilities.
The main objective of this project is to develop automated strategies for effective control and optimization of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) and water treatment facilities. It is proposed to achieve this objective by suitable instrumentation of the water treatment plants and the distribution networks, online acquisition and transmission of the information to a network management system, and developing control methods that can deal with large scale complex urban water distribution networks.The specific problems that will be addressed as part of this proposal are:
  - Development of control strategies to prevent wastage of water when it is available in excess and for equitably supplying it during     	    periods of water deficient conditions.
  - Development of optimal operating and scheduling strategies for both directly pumped WDNs and WDNs with local storage facilities (sumps    	and overhead tanks) for ensuring 24Ã—7 water supply.
  - Design and fabrication of a scaled down table-top reconfigurable model of a complex pipeline network for demonstrating and validating the proposed methods.
  - Evaluation of the proposed methods through numerical simulations and the experimental set-up.
 Demonstration of proposed methods in situ in the IIT Madras network.
